                <p>Cricket was introduced to Ceylon by the British and the first recorded match is dated 1832. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon was a report in the Colombo Journal on 5 September 1832 which called for the formation of a
                    cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed and matches began soon afterwards when it played, on the Rifle Green in Colombo, against a team from the 97th Regiment of Foot which was stationed on the island from 1825 to 1836.Through
                    the 19th century, cricket was essentially the preserve of European settlers and visitors but it gradually attracted the native Ceylonese who were, at first, often needed to make up the numbers</p>

                    <p>Dr John Rockwood was a noted administrator in Ceylonese cricket and he proposed the creation of a national board to govern and promote the game. This was founded in July 1922 as the Ceylon Cricket Association (CCA), the forerunner
                        of Sri Lanka Cricket.</p>

                        by Pakistan and West Indies were both in 1949, in each case to play two internationals</p>
